# Next.js/TypeScript: Starter Web App Code Sample

This TypeScript code sample demonstrates how to build web applications using Next.js and TypeScript.

Visit the ["Next.js Code Samples: Web App Security in Action"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/web-app/nextjs) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Hub"](https://auth0.com/developers/hub) to explore how you can secure Next.js applications written in TypeScript by implementing user authentication with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Next.js Project

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Execute this command to run your Next.js application in development:

```bash
npm run dev
```
